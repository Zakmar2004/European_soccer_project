# Football Match Outcome Prediction

## Project Description
This project analyzes football matches using the European Football Dataset from Kaggle. 
It includes data preprocessing using SQL, exploratory data analysis in Google Colab, and 
match outcome predictions based on bookmaker odds and team attributes.

## Dataset
- [European Soccer Database on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/hugomathien/soccer)
- The dataset includes match details, team attributes, players information and bookmaker predictions.

## Workflow
1. **Data Selection:** SQL queries were used to filter and process relevant data.
2. **Exploratory Analysis:** Conducted in Jupyter notebooks to understand the dataset.
3. **Prediction Models:** Match outcomes (win/draw/lose) were predicted using logistic regression.

## Repository Structure
- `data/`: Processed data.
- `Sql_script`: SQL queries used for data preprocessing.
- `European_soccer.ipynb`: Jupyter notebooks for data analysis and modeling.
